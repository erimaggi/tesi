 1. Grant of License.  This computer program (the "Software") and any copies that you make are owned by TreeAge.  You are permitted to use the Software only as expressly provided in this Agreement.  You agree to notify your employees and agents who may have access to the Software of the restrictions contained in this Agreement and to ensure their compliance with such restrictions.

 2. Limitations on Use.  One or more of the following paragraphs may apply, depending upon the license you have purchased:

 (a) Evaluation License.  If you have obtained a free Evaluation License, you may install the Software on only one (1) computer and use the Software only for evaluation purposes for a period of approximately 14 days (after which the Software will cease to function).  If you want to use the Software for any other purpose or for a longer period, you must purchase an appropriate license from TreeAge.  You may not attempt to extend the evaluation period through successive installations on one or more computers.

 (b) Single-User License.  If you purchased a Single-User License, you may use the Software on only one (1) computer at a time.  Subject to the written certification (form of required certificate available at http://www.treeage.com/SecondAuth) that you will be the sole user of the Software, you may also have up to two (2) concurrent licensed installations the Software on computers belonging to you (for example, a laptop computer in addition to your desktop computer).  The additional installation described in the preceding sentence is not available if you have a Student License.  Single-User Licenses may not be accessed remotely via a network, from a virtual machine, or by any other means.  Such installations require a Network License.  If your Single-User License is an annual license, paragraph 2(h) shall also apply.

 (c) Multi-User Pack License.  If you have purchased a Multi-User Pack License, you may install the Software only on a number of your entity's own computers not greater than the number authorized by your license.  The Software may not be installed on any additional computers (for example, laptop, home computers, or virtual machine).  This license is an annual license (see paragraph 2(h) below).

 (d) Network License.  If you have purchased a Network License, you may install the Software on one (1) network server for concurrent use of the Software on multiple computers over that network.  The number of concurrent users of the Software may never exceed the number of Software licenses purchased and assigned to your network.  The Software may not be installed on any additional computers (for example, laptop or home computers).  If your Network License is an annual license, paragraph 2(h) shall also apply.

 (e) Student License.  If you purchased a Student License, you may install the Software only on your own computer and you may use the Software only for your educational, non-commercial purposes.  This license is an annual license (see paragraph 2(h) below).

 (f) Educational Site License.  If you purchased an Educational Site License, you may install the Software on any number of computers at the same school.  Use of the Software is strictly limited to non-commercial, teaching purposes; this software is not, for example, licensed for research.  If your Educational Site License is an annual license, (see paragraph 2(h) below)shall also apply.

 (g) Beta Release or Pre-Release Versions.  If you have received a beta release or pre-release version of the Software, your license shall expire ninety (90) days from the date of its release (or such other period as indicated by the Software) (see paragraph 2(h) below).  TreeAge reserves the right not to release the Software commercially or to release a version of the Software having different features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics.  You acknowledge that the beta release or pre-release version licensed to you is not suitable for production use and may contain errors affecting its proper operation.

 (h) Licenses with Limited Duration.  If your license is for a limited duration (an Evaluation License, an annual license or a beta or pre-release license), the Software will cease to operate at the conclusion of the license term.  Information regarding whether your license is  limited in duration and, if so, the expiration date of the license, may be found in the Software's License Manager, under the Help menu, or by contacting TreeAge via e-mail (support@treeage.com).  You may not attempt to extend the life of Software licensed for a limited duration.

 (i) License purchased with Academic Discount.  If your license was purchased at the discounted, academic price, the Software is not licensed, and may not be used, for any commercial, professional, or other for-profit purpose.  This purchase requires that your organization is a formal university.  

 (j) License purchased with Non-Profit/Government Discount.  If your license was purchased at the discounted, non-profit/government price, the Software is not licensed, and may not be used, for any commercial, professional, or other for-profit purpose.  

 (k) Limited-Functionality Versions.  If your license is for a limited-functionality version of the Software (such as an Evaluation License, or certain other licenses), there are limitations imposed on various features, including model size and the ability to save files.  

 3. Backup Copy.  In addition to the installations authorized in Section 2 of this Agreement, whichever is applicable, you are entitled to make or retain only a single copy of the Software, to be used solely for backup or archival purposes.

 4. Prior Versions.  If you have received the Software as an upgrade, then the upgrade replaces the Software previously licensed.  The upgrade and associated license key do not constitute the granting of a second license to the Software, in that you may not use the Software upgrade in addition to the older version that it is replacing.  Your license to use the Software is expressly conditioned on your deleting the older version of the Software from your computer and network within seven (7) days.

 (d) Tech Support will be based on the then-current version of the Software and will be furnished only to users who have licensed and installed the then-current version of the Software.

 (e) If your License is time-limited, your right to receive Tech Support will expire when the License expires.

 (f) If your License is not time-limited, your right to receive Tech Support will expire on the first anniversary of your purchase of the License or, if you have extended your right to Tech Support through purchase of a Maintenance Agreement, upon expiration of the most recent Maintenance Agreement.

 EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE AND ACCOMPANYING MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND TREEAGE DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  TREEAGE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.
